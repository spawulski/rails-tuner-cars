Plan #1
I plan on scraping the internet for late 80's,
early 90's import cars that are for sale to aggregate
the car listings into 1 spot so it's easier for me to shop.

Plan #2
I would use the Magic: The Gathering dataset to organize
cards into sets and colours

I plan to have a database with the main table being called:

car listing:
Title:           varchar
Make:            varchar         FK
Model:           varchar         FK
URL:             varchar
Price:           float
Desription:      text
Location:        varchar
image_url:       varchar



Make:
Name:            varchar         PK, FK

Model:
Name:            varchar         PK, FK
